Version 1.0

-I am used to work using Managers. This approach leaves the controller to manage the information given from 
the view and the manager does the process and returns the information to the manager. This way there is an 
extra layer and each class (conrollers, managers and models) has a specific functionality. 
- In the ProjectFiles model I left two functions that basically do the same but have different where clauses. 
This is because I thought that if I but it all in one it would be more tedious for another person to read it. 
I don't know if the company approach is simplify code or make it more understandable. I followed the second approach.
